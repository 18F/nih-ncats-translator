# NIH NCATS Biomedical Translator prototypes

The [National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)](https://ncats.nih.gov/) launched the [Biomedical Data Translator (“Translator”)](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator) program in October 2016 in an effort to overcome challenges in application of the myriad of biomedical datasets that are available today for the greater public good.

18F began a [Path Analysis and Experiment & Iterate](https://18f.gsa.gov/how-we-work/) engagement with NCATS in March 2019. This repository holds prototypes associated with our experimentation and iteration.
